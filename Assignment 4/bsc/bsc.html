    <h1> British Shorthair cat </h1>

 <div class="item2"> <p>The British Shorthair is a study in roundness. He has a large round head, round eyes and rounded paws. Even his tail has a rounded tip. He was once known as the British Blue because he came only in that color, but these days his short, plush coat comes in many different colors and patterns. There is also a longhaired variety, called the British Longhair. Except for his coat, the British Longhair is the same as the British Shorthair.</p>
<p>A British Shorthair is a dignified, intelligent and affectionate companion. He‚Äôs not generally a lapcat, but he will want to be at your side on the sofa or at least nearby. Females tend to have a serious demeanor, while males are more happy-go-lucky. These laidback cats can get along well with dogs and are calm around children, but they don‚Äôt enjoy being hauled around. Teach children to treat them with respect.</p><p>The British Shorthair is big, but he shouldn‚Äôt be fat. Watch his food intake to make sure he doesn‚Äôt become obese. Encourage him to chase fishing-pole toys or peacock feathers for exercise.</p></div>
