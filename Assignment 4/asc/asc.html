 <div class="item2"> <p> Formerly used to keep rodents and vermin away from food stores, the American Shorthair still enjoys exercising her hunting skills on unsuspecting insects. As a smart, moderately active feline, she enjoys learning tricks and challenging her intelligence with puzzles and interactive toys.</p>
<p>She‚Äôs adaptable and good-natured, which makes her the ideal family companion. Although she loves attention from her people, including children, the American Shorthair does not like being carried and is fairly independent. She may curl up in your lap on occasion, but she may prefer to sit alongside you instead. She‚Äôll get along fine with a cat-friendly dog, but her hunting instincts may take over with pet birds and other small animals.</p> <p>As a working cat, American Shorthairs have a stocky, muscular build. Their muscular legs lend themselves to the American‚Äôs agility and endurance. They have a large head and full face, medium-sized ears and large, wide eyes.</p></div>
